# Description
In this Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp assignment, my job was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end had already been created. I built the back end, connected the two, and deployed the entire application to Heroku.
